✅ TDD – Test Driven Development
What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a development approach where: You write tests before writing the actual code.

TDD is a development approach where tests are written before code, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

Yes — test first, code later.

TDD Cycle
TDD follows a 3-step cycle called:

🔴 RED → 🟢 GREEN → 🔵 REFACTOR

RED
Write a test → it fails (because code doesn’t exist yet)

GREEN
Write the minimum code to pass the test

REFACTOR
Improve code quality without breaking tests

Repeat 🔁

Why TDD?

✔ Better design
✔ Fewer bugs
✔ Confidence while refactoring
✔ High test coverage
✔ Cleaner, modular code

Q1: Why write tests before code?
Answer:
It clarifies requirements, improves design, and ensures code is testable.

Q2: Does TDD slow development?
Answer:
Initially yes, but overall it speeds up development by reducing bugs and rework.

Q3: What should be tested in TDD?
Answer:
Business logic, edge cases, and critical paths — not UI or framework code.

Q4: Can TDD be used with Microservices?
Answer:
Yes. Unit tests for services and integration tests for service interactions.
