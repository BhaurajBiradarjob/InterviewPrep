Microservices : An application is built as a collection of small, independent services, each service doing one specific business function.

DDD -> Domain Driven Development

Simple Example (E-commerce)

Microservices could be:
User Service
Product Service
Order Service
Payment Service
Notification Service

Benefits of Microservices

✅ Scalability
✅ Faster development
✅ Fault isolation
✅ Tech flexibility
✅ Team autonomy

Challenges (Important!)

⚠️ Network latency
⚠️ Data consistency
⚠️ Monitoring complexity
⚠️ DevOps overhead
⚠️ Debugging is harder

Monolith : single project, single deployment

Pros

✔ Simple to build
✔ Easy debugging
✔ Fewer moving parts

❌ Cons

❌ Hard to scale
❌ One bug affects entire app
❌ Slow deployments

Microservices Interview Questions 🧠
Q1: Why Microservices?
👉 Scalability, flexibility, independent deployment.

Q2: Microservices vs Monolith?
👉 Monolith = single app, Microservices = multiple independent services.

Q3: Why separate DB per service?
👉 Loose coupling and service autonomy.

Q4: What is API Gateway?
👉 Single entry point handling security, routing, throttling.

Q5: How do services communicate?
👉 REST (sync) and messaging (async).

Q6: What is eventual consistency?
👉 Data may not be immediately consistent across services.

Q7: What are challenges?
👉 Monitoring, latency, data consistency, DevOps complexity.

Q8: How do you handle failures?
👉 Circuit breaker, retries, timeouts.

Q9: What is CQRS in Microservices?
👉 Separate read/write models inside services.

Q10: Azure services used?
👉 AKS, APIM, Service Bus, Cosmos DB.

5️⃣ Final Takeaway 🧠

✔ Monolith → simple
✔ Microservices → scalable
✔ API Gateway → must-have
✔ Azure + .NET → powerful combo
